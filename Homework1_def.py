# Hi , I hope you be alright , as you see this is my homework of def and import but this is only "def" part
# and the import part is in the next file
#in these files , I wrote a program to calculate the exponent , but I put it in def 
#and in next file , I used this def by importing ...
def Def():
    first_number = int(input("Enter your first number > "))
    second_number = int(input("Enter your second number > "))
    #to get number , we use int-input
    exponent = first_number**second_number 
    return exponent
    #we return the variable to be able to print
#It was the first part(Just def part) the next file is the continue of this file...
